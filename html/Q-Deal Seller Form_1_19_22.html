        <p class="para_heading_underline">Description of Sponsor and Guarantor Criteria</p>

        <p>
            Freddie Mac requires the deal Sponsor to be organized as a single asset, bankruptcy remote, Special Purpose Entity (SPE). Each
            SPE/Sponsor will be evaluated with respect to the criteria set forth in this Application Form for Approval. The SPE/Sponsor criteria
            are subject to change. Since the SPE/Sponsor must be formed for each specific deal and may not exist at the time of approval,
            Freddie Mac will allow either the Principal Counterparty or the Guarantor to complete and execute this application on the Sponsor's
            behalf
        </p>

        <p>
            This Application is for Multifamily TEBS Sponsor and Guarantor status only. It is not an application for approval as a Single Family
            Seller/Servicer, Multifamily Conventional Seller/Servicer, Multifamily SBL Seller/Servicer or Multifamily TAH Seller/Servicer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, the Sponsor and Guarantor do not need to be approved by Single Family prior to applying for Multifamily approval.
            Multifamily approval does not imply or include approval for Single Family. Multifamily does not have delegated authority to grant
            Single Family approval. Therefore, a Multifamily TEBS Sponsor application does not substitute for a Single Family application.
        </p>
