                <p>
                    Welcome to Freddie Mac Multifamily's Counterparty Application process. Freddie Mac evaluates all counterparties that wish to sell or service Conventional,
                    Targeted Affordable Housing (TAH), Small Balance Loans (SBL), or Structured Transaction loans for compliance with our requirements.
                    These requirements are detailed in the Multifamily Seller / Servicer Guide, which is available at https://mf.freddiemac.com/lenders/guide, and are subject to change.
                    A Counterparty application is required for each approval type requested (i.e., Conventional, TAH, SBL, or Structured Transactions).
                </p>

                <p>Approval of an institution is at Freddie Mac’s sole discretion. This Application is for Multifamily Seller/Servicer status only;
                    it is not an application for approval as a Single Family Seller/Servicer. If approval for both Single Family and Multifamily is desired,
                    separate applications must be submitted in accordance with the requirements under each designation. Additionally,
                    applicants need not be approved by Single Family prior to applying for Multifamily approval.
                    Multifamily approval does not imply or include approval for Single Family. Multifamily does not have delegated authority to grant Single Family approval,
                    therefore a Multifamily Seller/Servicer application does not substitute for a Single Family Application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key term definitions used by Freddie Mac in this application process are provided below:

                    <strong>Corporate Insurance:</strong> All applicants are required to have fidelity insurance and mortgagee's errors and omissions (E&O) insurance
                    coverage as described below. Fidelity insurance protects the applicant against loss resulting from dishonesty or fraud committed by
                    officers & employees of the applicant and by other individuals covered by the policy. E&O insurance protects the applicant against
                    loss resulting from errors and omissions by employees.

                <p>
                    A mortgage impairment or mortgage interest policy is acceptable as a substitute for an E&O policy provided that the required level of
                    coverage and terms are provided. E&O coverage per mortgage with a per mortgage limitation policy is acceptable if the insurer's limit
                    of insurance or liability per mortgage is no less than the unpaid principal balance of the largest mortgage originated, sold or serviced
                    by your institution, whichever is highest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The evidence of insurance should specify the entity covered, type of coverage, coverage amounts, loss payee, deductibles, and
                    policy duration. Examples of calculations of the required minimum insurance limits are as follows:

                    The information included in this application package is true to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that
                    misrepresentation constitutes cause for suspension or disqualification to sell to and/or service mortgages for Freddie Mac and may
                    be cause for Freddie Mac to exercise any other remedies available. Furthermore, I fully understand that I may be subject to civil or
                    criminal penalties for knowingly making any false statements concerning any information in this application package.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I further warrant that while the application is pending action by Freddie Mac, I will notify the Freddie Mac Customer Compliance
                    Senior Director of any material factor that may influence the application decision. Some examples of material factors include, but are
                    not limited to, bankruptcy, appointment of a trustee or receiver for the applicant or its property, significant deterioration in financial
                    condition, and supervisory or regulatory action by the applicant's regulatory agency.
                </p>
