                Freddie Mac evaluates Conventional, Targeted Affordable Housing, Small Balance Loan, and Structured Transaction Seller/Servicer
                applicants with respect to criteria such as financial condition, management experience, and current and past origination and
                servicing performance. Approval of an institution is at Freddie Mac’s sole discretion. Freddie Mac’s evaluation criteria are subject to
                change.
            </p>
            <p>
                The applicant must have previously submitted the Notification of Interest Form and been approved by Freddie Mac to apply following
                the Prescreen Process.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Application is for Multifamily Seller/Servicer status only. It is not an application for approval as a Single Family Seller/Servicer. If
                approval for both Single Family and Multifamily is desired, separate applications must be submitted in accordance with the
                requirements under each designation. Additionally, applicants need not be approved by Single Family prior to applying for Multifamily
                approval. Multifamily approval does not imply or include approval for Single Family. Multifamily does not have delegated authority to
                grant Single Family approval, therefore a Multifamily Seller/Servicer application does not substitute for a Single Family Application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Definitions of some key terms used by Freddie Mac are provided below.

            <p>
                Freddie Mac will seek to verify any submitted application information as part of the review of the application package. For example,
                information on resumes (required for principals and managing executives) may be independently verified. An on-site review of an
                applicant’s facilities and operations may be necessary as part of the approval process.

            <p>
                While the application is pending action by Freddie Mac, the applicant must notify Freddie Mac in writing of any material factor that
                could affect the application decision. Each applicant must also certify that, if approved, it will comply with all the terms, conditions,

                All standards concerning Freddie Mac’s purchase programs and qualifications for Seller/Servicer approval are subject to change by
                Freddie Mac at any time without notice or publication. The Guide is available on Freddie Mac's Website for reference.

            Net Worth, Loan Servicing and Insurance requirements from the Guide.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Financial Condition:</strong> Freddie Mac will review each applicant’s financial condition, capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, and
            liquidity. The applicant must meet the minimum eligibility requirements of $5 million minimum net worth as defined by generally
            accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and liquid assets of $500,000.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Servicing Volume:</strong> Completion of the Conventional, TAH, SBL and/or Structured Transaction Seller/Servicer Forms, as applicable,
            along with other attachments, will help Freddie Mac evaluate your multifamily servicing operation.

                $500 million of mortgages secured by multifamily properties
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Corporate Insurance:</strong> All applicants are required to have fidelity insurance and mortgagee's errors and omissions (E&O) insurance
            coverage as described below. Fidelity insurance protects the applicant against loss resulting from dishonesty or fraud committed by
            officers & employees of the applicant and by other individuals covered by the policy. E&O insurance protects the applicant against
            loss resulting from errors and omissions by employees.
        </p>

        <p>
            A mortgage impairment or mortgage interest policy is acceptable as a substitute for an E&O policy provided that the required level of
            coverage and terms are provided. E&O coverage per mortgage with a per mortgage limitation policy is acceptable if the insurer's limit
            of insurance or liability per mortgage is no less than the unpaid principal balance of the largest mortgage originated, sold or serviced
            by your institution, whichever is highest.
        </p>

        <p>
            The evidence of insurance should specify the entity covered, type of coverage, coverage amounts, loss payee, deductibles, and
            policy duration. Examples of calculations of the required minimum insurance limits are as follows:
